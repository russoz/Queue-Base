NAME

	Queue::Base - Simple OO style queue implementation.

DESCRIPTION

	The Queue::Base is a simple implementation for queue structures using an
	OO interface.

	Although it is s known fact for most of the Perl programmers out there
	that one can easily implement a queue using arrays and the built-in
	functions provided by the language, we do believe it is worthy to have
	a well-defined class, to provide a consistency.

	TMTOWDY is appreciated, but bicarbonate is a good thing.
