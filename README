NAME
	Queue::Base - Simple OO style queue implementation.

DESCRIPTION
	The Queue::Base is a simple implementation for queue structures using an
	OO interface. Provides basic functionality: nothing less - nothing more.

REASON
	I started writing this module because I didn't find a similar queue 
	implementation on CPAN.
	I know that is very simple to simulate a queue, but I wanted something 
	with kind of a standard interface, which is simple and very intuitive to 
	use.
	
	My goal in writting the module was the clarity of the interface and not
	the performance of the implementation. I assume that if you consider the
	performance critical, you not use this module; alternatively you could 
	manipulate arrays directly, or perphaps you could use another programmming 
	language.
